        "When I compared snowfall in January and February over the past three years I found a few things. I found that in the month of January snowfall increased as the years progressed, with January '19 having the greatest amount of snow in terms of month and year. February usually had a higher amount of snowfall than January, other than in '19. In terms of cumulative snowfall over all years February (33.1 inches) had a higher amount than January (29 inches)."
